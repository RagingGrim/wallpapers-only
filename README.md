# Wallpapers-only

A rewrite of my script which pulls wallpapers from the internet. The application is written in c++ and has cross-platform support via compiler flags.
I take no responsability for whatever images the script pull even with filters active.

Valgrind reports errors. I will probably do another rewrite of this once the windows compilation works.
